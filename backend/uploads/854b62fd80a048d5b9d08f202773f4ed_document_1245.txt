This is a requirement

[13/10/20, 15:32:25] Tin Mar Win: Can you pls advise what does he mean?
[13/10/20, 15:40:50] Ace Firesafety Syed: This part we need to verify again on site.

Most probably no need to get Town Council/ HDB approval.
[13/10/20, 15:43:22] Ace Firesafety Syed: There are 3 ways to raise the cables up to level 2 and level 3.

1) - Through existing Riser / shaft

2) Along the building facade (need to consult HDB/ Town Council)

3) along the staircase (which may not be allowed by scdf)

So we are hoping that there is a riser nearby where we can pull the wires through
[13/10/20, 15:52:37] Tin Mar Win: Can you pls provide the quote for Town council /HDB approval at common area?

(How about the staircase? Did you check can approve?) 

2) If waiver approveÔºå then submit to HDB.

3) After HDB approve then  submit to SCDF for BP and FP? Or concurrently?
[4/11/20, 11:56:00] Ace Firesafety Syed: 1) Waiver application is only for the single Staircase as at existing (because you need at lease 2 exit by law)

2) Once Waiver Approved, then submit BP SCDF

3) Then Submit HDB
[4/11/20, 11:56:47] Ace Firesafety Syed: SCDF Waiver application: $1,500/-

HDB Submission : $3,350/-
- Aircon

[4/11/20, 12:08:34] Shao Wei Manager: Require fire rated partition for under staircase, partition wall next to staircase, the partition at L1 tenant premises.
[4/11/20, 12:09:22] Ace Firesafety Syed: yes

[4/11/20, 12:09:22] Shao Wei Manager: Can check whether need to change full staircase? Can comply? Coz need to cost in if need to change full staircaseüòÖ
[4/11/20, 12:10:40] Ace Firesafety Syed: no need change the staircase

i have checked the fire code

Timber Staircase is allowed

Provided all the structures supporting the staircase are of non-combustible structures (Iron/ Steel/ Metal/ Concrete etc)
[4/11/20, 12:12:38] Shao Wei Manager: üëç at least this can save. Hahaha.

[6/11/20, 18:37:30] Shao Wei Manager: Syed, do you do FSC02?
[6/11/20, 18:40:41] Ace Firesafety Syed: Hi,

Why do we need form 02?
[6/11/20, 18:42:44] Shao Wei Manager: For the fire rated partition?
[6/11/20, 18:48:22] Ace Firesafety Syed: Normally, form 1 can cover fire-rated products. Form 2 is used for any minor deviation from the approved plans. For example, if you propose 1 hr fire rated board on plan but use 2 hr fire rated board on site, then form 2 is used.

More importantly, may i know who is asking, because he/she may have other insights to it.
[6/11/20, 18:50:42] Shao Wei Manager: Our partition contractor.
[6/11/20, 18:58:37] Ace Firesafety Syed: Anyway we do FSC 02 

But for fire rated or regulated fire safety products we use form 01 and there‚Äôs a new declaration form we need to fill up together with the COC/ DOC
[6/11/20, 19:01:43] Shao Wei Manager: So you also do COC/ DOC?
[6/11/20, 19:07:14] Shao Wei Manager: How you charge for : 
1) form 1
2) FSC 02
3) DOC/ COC
[6/11/20, 19:07:26] Ace Firesafety Syed: Nope coc doc from supplier

They get the cert from singapore accreditation council
[6/11/20, 19:11:05] Shao Wei Manager: Oh yes. Sorry.
[6/11/20, 19:12:20] Shao Wei Manager: BTW, for AMK, only the 2nd new door at the staircase need to be fire rated correct? 
The L1 door to the Money Max need to be fire rated too?
[7/11/20, 12:54:26] Shao Wei Manager: Hi Syed, how high the chance to get the waiver?
[7/11/20, 12:54:35] Shao Wei Manager: For AMK 702
[7/11/20, 13:03:12] Ace Firesafety Syed: Very high chance

[7/11/20, 13:04:56] Ace Firesafety Syed: Provided they install hose reel call point alarm bell

And the staircase is fully compartmented
[7/11/20, 13:05:48] Shao Wei Manager: Hose reel install at 1st floor?
[7/11/20, 13:06:02] Ace Firesafety Syed: I have a proposal to simplify the issue. 

But the tenant downstairs must agree
[7/11/20, 13:06:40] Ace Firesafety Syed: Every floor needs hosereel
[7/11/20, 13:06:56] Shao Wei Manager: Can propose?
[7/11/20, 13:07:12] Ace Firesafety Syed: I can propose a sketch
[7/11/20, 13:07:15] Ace Firesafety Syed: I will send u
[7/11/20, 13:07:22] Shao Wei Manager: Tenant also discussing with landlord
[7/11/20, 13:07:31] Shao Wei Manager: Thanks thanks
[7/11/20, 13:07:42] Shao Wei Manager: Seems the tenant very keen to get the place
[7/11/20, 15:27:37] Ace Firesafety Syed: Slight Deviation to the layout at site... but i think you get the point

1) Staircase has to be totally compartmented from occupied/ tenanted area at both 1st and 2nd storey

2) Staircase has to be ventilated, hence we proposed the demolition of existing partition and carve the tenanted area at 1st storey to along the toilet wall, with 1hr fire rated partition and door. This will allow the existing window to provide ventilation for staircase.

3) Both levels would need a set of
-Hose Reel
-call Point
- Alarm Bell
- Strobe Light

4) adequate provisions of Exit lights and emergency lights 

5) To Proposed Strobe lights at all 4 toilets **needs consideration again... we see how...

The Challenge here would be:

a) To get the tenant below to agree for the works to be done at staircase area and area affecting their operations and space.
[7/11/20, 19:10:02] Shao Wei Manager: Thank you so much Syed, the drawings and explanations are very clear and understandable. Make it so much easier to understand now.
[7/11/20, 19:10:16] Shao Wei Manager: I will explain to client.

Anyway if put them no more transparent already correct?
[19/11/20, 17:17:46] Ace Firesafety Syed: im guessing this is condominium... at the private enclose space?
[19/11/20, 17:17:50] Ace Firesafety Syed: PES
[19/11/20, 17:22:24] Ace Firesafety Syed: if it is indeed PES,

then there is " Vertical Fire Spread" Clause in the fire code

that means..

there must be a minimum 1hr fire rated barrier between the 2 units such that any fire emergency at level 1, must not spread through the window openings at level 2.

hence, there is a need for 1hr fire rated partition.

this is a common problem at condominium.

[17/12/20, 10:46:33] Shao Wei Manager: So I guess the exhaust system is referring to suppression system
[17/12/20, 10:53:19] Ace Firesafety Syed: Nope
[17/12/20, 10:54:09] Ace Firesafety Syed: Exhaust system is the hood and the ducts(MV)

If they use gas for cooking

They need to install suppression system under the hood (FP)
[17/12/20, 10:57:16] Shao Wei Manager: So if there is open flame cooking with gas , he must apply for all 3 plans?

Client asking: 
The detectors were replaced 1:1, but I was told that the radius of heat detector is suppose to smaller, can you advise on this?
Will there be any installation done in the common corridor/2nd level too? 
Syed, can share with us the what to reply to client.
‚Äé[2/1/21, 10:00:10] Ace Firesafety Syed: ‚Äéimage omitted
[2/1/21, 10:08:13] Ace Firesafety Syed: From Heat detector to heat detector is 5m ( at site can comply)

from wall to detector reduced to 2.5m ( at site can comply)
[2/1/21, 10:10:22] Ace Firesafety Syed: smoke detector is 

7m from smoke detector to smoke detector
and 3.5m from smoke detector to wall

so there is a reduction of 1m radius... but the unit is small...

at 2.5m radius, a heat detector can provide sufficient coverage at the current location.
[2/1/21, 10:11:09] Ace Firesafety Syed: **Will there be any installation done in the common corridor/2nd level too?

[19/2/21, 21:43:34] Ace Firesafety Syed: sorry i was away... sleeping... not feeling well.

Anyway, i read through. 

1) Need to submit BP for the retention of the partition walls

2) need to comply with the latest and current code of practice which is to install automatic fire alarm system (detectors), manual fire alarm call points, alarm bells and strobe lights.

Also hose reel may require if not available on site.

Another issue would be the air-con lodgement, though not mentioned by HDB. 

So BP and FP ($2800)
[22/2/21, 09:01:00] Shao Wei Manager: These total 3 units. So each unit need it own submission correct? Or one submission only? 
Same landlord selling to one client.
[22/2/21, 11:41:49] Ace Firesafety Syed: I think one unit
[22/2/21, 11:41:59] Ace Firesafety Syed: Subdivided into 3
[24/2/21, 12:44:00] Shao Wei Manager: Hi. As spoken. I need to apply and submit a fire safety certificate for installation of temper glass on my roof trellis to SCDF as requested. 
Kindly provide me with quotation.

Thanks

[4/3/21, 16:16:48] Ace Firesafety Syed: Hi guys, 

I completed the MAA plan for Le Rouge change alley yesterday.

When i checked I realised that the ‚Äúupdated‚Äù plan given is also wrong and different from my observations on site

Since they do not have the correct CAD plan, i need to come down measure and draw up the as built plan.

Can someone arrange for my site visit and survey Saturday 5pm?
[4/3/21, 16:23:16] Shao Wei Manager: Ok. I check.
[4/3/21, 16:26:49] Shao Wei Manager: Hi Syed, this asking for the reference number by SCDF of the receipt of submission
[4/3/21, 16:30:16] Shao Wei Manager: Hi All,

 

I quote email below from Ms Chen of Ezzogenics : ‚ÄúOnce we receive the NOA, we will send  to you and together with another form for authorization for RI. After this step, then will need to wait for the SCDF certification.‚Äù

 

Means we are just at the application stage? There will still be another form for authorization for RI?

 

Yes, please send us the reference number by SCDF of the receipt of submission.

 

Thank you and regards,

[27/4/21, 22:51:58] Ace Firesafety Syed: another thing is about the Warehouse unit at 46a Tanjong Penjuru....


i did some intensive study.... assuming everything else can be complied with (the compartment walls/ fire shutter/ escape distance and number of exits etc), there is still one fundamental issue that WE cannot resolve.

ie. the smoke control system.

based on research, this floor/ unit is a single user multi storey warehouse with vehicular ramp with an area about 9800sqm...

for such size, the smoke control installed would be: "ENGINEERED SMOKE CONTROL SYSTEM" 

this system was specially designed and built for the whole storey/ unit. (The whole storey WAS a single user warehouse subdivided into 2 units).

also, based on my observation, the ONLY ducted engineering smoke control system available in the client's unit is labled "SEF-4-4" which indicates that there are 3 other such system for the whole unit ( SEF-1-4, SEF-2-4, SEF- 3-4)

again, this is an engineered system, where volume, area and length and position of such SEF fans are carefully considered by a specialist and engineering team.

when we proposed a sub-division of this huge warehouse unit into two units, the smoke control system designed will be affected as such "SEF-4-4" which happens to be inside this client's unit will be redundant and yet the "neighboring unit" may be insufficient.

Smoke Vent system was also considered for this unit, assuming the neighbouring unit agrees to re-do their engineering smoke control system. but the max distance coverage (24m) is unlikely to comply.

Smoke purging system was also considered. but may not be compatible if we were to consider a single-type system for the whole floor.

in conclusion, we are not able to proceed with this project. We advise client to speak to the building management and their term engineer, especially the smoke control engineer on how they can resolve the smoke control issue.
[27/4/21, 22:58:18] Ace Firesafety Syed: for the emergency light (UFO)... u guys installing it right?

[4/5/21, 16:59:53] David Chan: Pls refresh my memory... tenant already ownself change for URA. SCDF We doing right
[4/5/21, 17:02:03] Ace Firesafety Syed: Between "Student Study Area" and "Tuition Centre" although somewhat similar,

but "Tuition Centre" carries more value/ weight... as such in the future, if he intends to convert into a tuition centre like his original unit next door, there is no need to do another change of use.

to simplify:

A tuition centre consist of study area class room etc...

but a study area by definition is not a tuition centre...
[4/5/21, 17:02:58] Ace Firesafety Syed: hence the better option would be "Tuition centre"
[4/5/21, 17:03:27] David Chan: So his URA should be Tuition Centre ..
[4/5/21, 17:03:53] Ace Firesafety Syed: URA doesnt matter much....
[4/5/21, 17:08:12] Ace Firesafety Syed: URA will always allow the change of use... except for some trade in some district for example:

Massage parlor 
Night Clubs, Pub 
Pool/ Snooker centre
KTV

in housing estate or in historical districts...

other than these, they will allow the change of use, provided we meet other agencies' requirements

plus im not sure if there is an intake behind the FCU that requires a bit of ventilation for air circulation?

5) Upon application of change of trade, HDB will issue a letter... annex A.... send that to us.... there may be other instructions that HDB require us to do... example, upgrade change door... retain or re-apply or apply new for Aircon systems... these are cost that needs to be included.

The rest will false ceiling follow aircon height plus additional 300mm

Which is ok.

But since the partition is full height to slab, then the original 1st layer sprinkler is affected

But only one door. The main entrance, no back door.

[21/9/23, 16:49:55] Ace Firesafety Syed: 1.5/ sqm
[21/9/23, 16:55:09] Shao Wei Manager: 147sqm x 1.5= 220 kids
[21/9/23, 16:56:48] Shao Wei Manager: But no back door. Can approve?
[21/9/23, 16:57:19] Ace Firesafety Syed: 147/ 1.5
[21/9/23, 16:58:14] Ace Firesafety Syed: Sorry,

[21/9/23, 17:01:10] Ace Firesafety Syed: No back door, cannot already
[21/9/23, 17:02:05] Ace Firesafety Syed: must meet 2 requirements

1) More than 15m length, needs a secondary exit...

2) More than 50pax, needs 2 exit...
[21/9/23, 17:02:32] Ace Firesafety Syed: so with only one exit, it doesn't comply with 2 fire codes
[21/9/23, 17:03:40] Shao Wei Manager: This 24m length. Item 1 failed
[21/9/23, 17:04:16] Shao Wei Manager: So even with less than  50 kids, still fail correct ?

[21/9/23, 20:03:17] Ace Firesafety Syed: Drawing on plan and construction on site may differ a bit

For construction i think should be 200mm because there will be lintol installed above and the lintol needs support 

Also need to consider door frame.

For drawing we put 200mm
[21/9/23, 20:03:46] Ace Firesafety Syed: 100mm before door frame
[21/9/23, 20:04:15] Shao Wei Manager: Ok. Noted
[21/9/23, 20:04:19] Shao Wei Manager: Thank you so much
[21/9/23, 22:29:07] David Chan: Lintel height 200mm and width 100mm.
[22/9/23, 01:56:45] David Chan: I check scdf one way travel requirements, for school, sprinklered 25m max and non-sprinkered 15m. Max dead end sprinklered 20m (I don‚Äôt understand). Exit to out door Ground floor seems can more people. Pls help to check, agent request us to sign Loi tomorrow.
[22/9/23, 01:56:54] David Chan: Customer sent this
[22/9/23, 10:51:39] Ace Firesafety Syed: If sprinkler protected 

Yes 25m max travel distance 

But based on the drawing, the number of pax is approximately 64

Exceeded the 50pax for one way exit.
[22/9/23, 11:06:29] David Chan: 100mm

Or one room change to store room? 
For classroom is 1.5sqm/pax
For office and store room? 
Also the common walkway need to be 1.5m width correct?
[22/9/23, 15:20:42] Ace Firesafety Syed: 1) yes the pax number will change(less pax)
2) store room no pax

3)yes 1.5

Then Rooms 1 to 4 all need to shift up coz we need to follow existing hallway ceiling height, also maybe relocate coz sprinkler points not center to classrooms or too close to new partitions

610mm minimum width.
[6/1/24, 12:27:18] Ace Firesafety Syed: 2 pax = min. 610mm clear opening width
[6/1/24, 12:47:07] Ace Firesafety Syed: Logically the aircon pipe should go up‚Ä¶ otherwise how do u put the false ceiling? 

Below the window level?
[6/1/24, 13:53:07] Ace Firesafety Syed: This project I will go tomorrow. I  have another inspection nearby so tomorrow is good.

2) It seems like a NEW duct was installed, hence the new 141deg Sprinkler head was added.

3) You need to submit BP (for new layout), FP (for sprinkler & Suppression System (if open flame is used)) and also MV (for the new Kitchen Hood)

4) If you already have all the necessary approvals  mentioned above, ONLY YOUR QP can apply for FSC under his project registration.

Hi,

Can u send your Hose reel installer this Wednesday for discussion at Rowell road at 2:30pm?

We need to update the locations of installation etc

They want us to start work this Saturday
[15/4/24, 19:40:53] Shao Wei Manager: Can. Will be Ashraful, same last few times
[15/4/24, 19:43:40] Ace Firesafety Syed: Ok üëå thanks üôè
[16/4/24, 08:57:55] Shao Wei Manager: Syed, is the running of piping and installatuon of fire hose also this Sat? 
Just realize Ashraful have his core trade course on this Sat 8am-1pm. On line though
[16/4/24, 08:59:22] Ace Firesafety Syed: that was what they insisted.
[16/4/24, 08:59:43] Ace Firesafety Syed: I already told her a few times that.

normally partition works must settle first
[16/4/24, 09:00:31] Ace Firesafety Syed: her reasoning was, 

the operator do not want too many contractors on site... because they are concurrently operating the clinic
[16/4/24, 09:01:22] Shao Wei Manager: üòÖ
[16/4/24, 09:01:37] Ace Firesafety Syed: it really does not make sense....

our fire safety devices, may pose as an obstruction to their partition demolition or erection later.
[16/4/24, 09:01:46] Ace Firesafety Syed: it may be damaged also
[16/4/24, 09:02:42] Ace Firesafety Syed: i will attend the meeting tomorrow. 

we see what they say again on site...
[16/4/24, 09:02:51] Shao Wei Manager: They very silly. Cannot think properly. 
I think coz agent want to complete their part and don't want to get involve with the renovation
[16/4/24, 09:04:15] Shao Wei Manager: Yeah. See how first. I will add worker to help Ashraful or we work til later lor. No choice.
[16/4/24, 09:04:45] Ace Firesafety Syed: maybe she dont understand... so i speak to the designer or contractor first.
[16/4/24, 09:05:29] Ace Firesafety Syed: how do you install hose reel... then later they hack the door behind... 

the hose reel will pose as an obstruction to their hacking.
[16/4/24, 09:05:48] Ace Firesafety Syed: anyway... i need to advice your men where to install the hose reel.
[16/4/24, 09:15:55] Shao Wei Manager: I think they want run the pipe first. Install hose reel later after renovation

If SCDF / your contractor advised that there‚Äôs no requirement for this listing system, then it won‚Äôt be necessary for you.

Possible to just leave it as-is?

[29/4/25, 16:56:15] Marie Igao ID: I understand the water mist and heat detectors wasn‚Äôt removed. 

The landlord‚Äôs concern is that false ceilings have been installed below them, so they would like to check if your QP/fire contractor had already assessed and adjusted the fire protection system accordingly?

If so, could they kindly confirm if the necessary submission to SCDF was made, and whether approval was obtained?
[29/4/25, 16:56:15] Marie Igao ID: Or if your QP had proposed any alternative fire safety measures for the current setup, and if these have already been submitted and approved by SCDF?
[29/4/25, 16:56:15] Marie Igao ID: Basically, we just need to confirm whether any alternative fire safety measures were proposed by your QP for the false ceiling works, and if so, whether they have already been submitted and approved by SCDF.
If everything has been cleared, it‚Äôll help us close the loop with the landlord‚Äôs side more smoothly.

Thanks again for your help!

[29/4/25, 17:07:03] Marie Igao ID: Syed if not necessary for this existing water mist system, can we proceed the SCDF submissions? 

They didn't mentioned that we have to engage by them, can we propose and proceed for SCDF submissions?
[29/4/25, 17:17:12] Ace Firesafety Syed: The MCST/ building owner must give us directive 

Not the property agent

[16/5/25, 15:59:16] Marie Igao ID: I think 4pcs wall mount
[16/5/25, 16:00:39] Ace Firesafety Syed: *IMPORTANT*

From your Video, there are a few things that needs to be done.

1) The staircase is not compartmented. 

you need to restore the staircase back to original state OR, compartment the staircase with 1hr fire rated door and wall.

2) how many exits are then on 2nd floor?

3) are there any existing aircon or will you install new aircon- This is for HDB submission.

[16/5/25, 16:46:43] Ace Firesafety Syed: if there are 2 exits for 2nd storey,

then, u can use 1hr Fire rated Dry wall partition instead of Masonry AAC Block wall
[16/5/25, 16:47:48] Ace Firesafety Syed: The problem with this is that the staircase does not have any ventilation when the doors are shut.

unless you remove the existing door, and just use metal gate
[16/5/25, 16:51:31] Ace Firesafety Syed: also the exit door from the clinic, when swung open in the direction of Exit, must not obstruct the egress of exit path of occupants from 2nd floor.

need to recess the door further inwards
[16/5/25, 16:51:51] Marie Igao ID: Yes okay, the existing also is partition wall below stairs
